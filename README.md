# WebServer
The client sends a HTTP request through a Web Browser which sends it to the server. Here it waits for a response back from the web server. The request is parsed then retrieved. The HTML message appears on the browser before sending back the response to the client (Through PyCharm IDE). If the request file is not found by the web server, a 404 Error will display.
